One of the best college to pursue engineering in Bengaluru. Athough it lacks infrastructure and enough support from both the central and state government, the students and teachers are doing their best to keep up the glory of the 100 year old institution. The students especially are of exceptional quality. Even though they face numerous hurdles during their college life, they emerge being the best of lot. The students here are admitted only by CET. So only meritorious students take up admission here. Also the students come from almost the same economic background providing a more awesome experience. After all its the very own college of Bharat Ratna Sir M. Visvesvaraya. So expect the quality also the same!
